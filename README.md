# pi-codex-goal

Codex-style goal tracking for pi.

This package adds a `/goal` command plus three model-callable tools:

- `get_goal`
- `create_goal`
- `update_goal`

Goal state is stored in pi session custom entries, so it follows session history, resume, fork, tree navigation, reload, and compaction behavior without an external database.

## Install

```sh
pi install npm:pi-codex-goal
```

Install from GitHub:

```sh
pi install https://github.com/fitchmultz/pi-codex-goal
```

For local development from this repository:

```sh
npm install
pi install .
```

## User Commands

```text
/goal
/goal Build the requested feature and verify it end to end
/goal pause
/goal resume
/goal clear
```

`/goal` with no arguments reports the current objective, status, token budget, token usage, and elapsed active time. A plain `/goal <objective>` starts a new goal or replaces the current one after confirmation.

This intentionally matches Codex TUI behavior: token budgets are set through the model tool rather than parsed from `/goal --tokens`.

## Model Tools

`create_goal` starts a goal with an objective and optional positive token budget. It fails if a goal already exists.

`get_goal` returns the current goal state and usage.

`update_goal` only accepts `status: "complete"`, matching Codex's model-side contract. The extension reports final token and elapsed-time usage before marking the goal complete.

## Behavior

While a goal is active, the extension:

- tracks elapsed active time between turns and tool completions
- adds completed assistant turn token usage when the active model reports it
- marks the goal `budgetLimited` when a positive token budget is reached
- sends hidden steering messages when budget is reached or when the agent is idle but the goal is still active
- shows live elapsed active time and compact/exact token counts in the pi footer when UI is available

Token counts are formatted with commas and compact abbreviations, for example `123M (123,456,789) tokens`. Token totals use pi's completed assistant turn usage (`usage.totalTokens`), which includes input, output, cache read, and cache write tokens when the active model reports them. Pi does not currently expose a separate extension usage total for automatic compaction summary calls.
