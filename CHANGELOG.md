# Changelog

## 0.1.3 - 2026-05-06

- Corrects the README behavior summary to describe completed assistant turn token accounting.

## 0.1.2 - 2026-05-06

- Counts completed assistant turn usage via pi's `usage.totalTokens` instead of using context-window deltas, so goal token totals track tokens sent and received across compaction.
- Keeps elapsed-time accounting stable before and after compaction while continuing to persist active goal state.

## 0.1.1 - 2026-05-06

- Marks pi runtime peer dependencies as optional so `pi install npm:pi-codex-goal` stays lightweight while still documenting the extension runtime contract.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-05-06

- Initial public release.
- Adds Codex-style `/goal` tracking for pi.
- Adds model-callable `get_goal`, `create_goal`, and `update_goal` tools.
- Persists goal state in pi session custom entries for resume, reload, fork, tree navigation, and compaction.
- Starts and resumes goals with hidden follow-up messages so active objectives keep moving.
- Shows live elapsed active time and compact/exact token counts in the pi footer.
